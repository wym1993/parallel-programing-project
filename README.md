# Parallel Programming Project

## Intro

This repository is the code for [parallel programming courses project](https://github.com/webgpu/2017fa_ece408_project). In this project, we implemented and optimized the CPU and GPU version of forward propagation of neural network.

## Methods

To optimize the GPU version of forward propagation, we implement the following methods.

* Shared memory

* Unroll

* Matrix mapping

## Result

Our team is in top 20% over 100 teams.
